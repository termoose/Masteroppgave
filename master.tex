\begin{abstract}
Elliptic curve cryptography is a fairly new approach to public-key cryptography.
The elliptic curve chosen should be such that its number of points is divisible by
a large prime factor. Ideally there should be a prime number of points on the curve.

In this paper we present the first efficient point counting algorithm due to Schoof,
before given a significant improvement due to Elkies. In the final section I give Satoh's
algorithm which is even faster and has paved the way for the field of $p$-adic point counting.
A thorough introduction to algebraic geometry and the theory of elliptic curves is given along the way.
