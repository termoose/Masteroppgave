\begin{abstract}
Elliptic curve cryptography is an approach to public-key cryptography.
The elliptic curve chosen should be such that its number of points is divisible by
a large prime factor. Ideally there should be a prime number of points on the curve.

In this paper we present the first efficient point counting algorithm due to Schoof,
before giving a significant improvement due to Elkies. In the final section I give Satoh's
algorithm which is even faster for fields of small
characteristic, and has paved the way for the field of $p$-adic point counting.

\section*{Preface}
At the start of my final year at the university I was fairly uncertain as to what my thesis would
be about. After having consulted several potential advisors, all with
very interesting topics, I finally talked to Kristian Gj\o steen
who presented me with suggestion for a thesis concerning elliptic curves.
I had for a long time been interested in number theory which is why I finally settled on this topic.

I would like to thank my high school teacher Thuy Skj\ae veland for being the first to spark
my interest in mathematics. In addition I would like to thank Erlend Hamberg for all the
much needed coffee and backgammon breaks through the semester.

A special thanks goes out to my thesis advisor Kristian Gj\o steen who always explained
things in such a way that even I could grasp them. This guy has an answer to everything.
