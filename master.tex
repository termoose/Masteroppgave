\begin{abstract}
Elliptic curve cryptography is an approach to public-key cryptography.
The elliptic curve chosen should be such that its number of points is divisible by
a large prime factor. Ideally there should be a prime number of points on the curve.

In this paper we present the first efficient point counting algorithm due to Schoof,
before giving a significant improvement due to Elkies. In the final section I give Satoh's
algorithm which is even faster and has paved the way for the field of $p$-adic point counting.
